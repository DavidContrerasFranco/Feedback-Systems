# Feedback-Systems
Projects for the course Feedback Systems taken in Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali during the 2020-1 Semester. Each folder contains the corresponding files for the lab and the report.

## Covid-19-Model
This project makes a Covid-19 model based on the SCIR epidemic model and uses differential equations to define the interaction between the states and basic data analysis to determine the parameters of this model base on the data gathered by esri Colombia. From this, the stability, observability, and controllability of the model is found prior to making a simulation to determine when the health care ICU capacity will be fulled.
